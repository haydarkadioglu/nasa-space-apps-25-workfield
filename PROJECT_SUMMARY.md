# Project Summary

**NASA Exoplanet Hunter** is an AI-powered web application developed by the **Kozmik Zihinler (Cosmic Minds)** team for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge. Our solution addresses the "A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI" challenge by creating an intelligent classification system that analyzes real NASA mission data from Kepler, K2, and TESS telescopes. The application features three specialized machine learning models: a Gradient Boosting classifier for K2 data (97% accuracy), a LightGBM model for Kepler data (85.36% accuracy), and a Random Forest classifier for TESS data (89.94% accuracy). Built with TypeScript and ONNX Runtime, the web-based tool enables researchers and enthusiasts to classify exoplanet candidates in real-time through an intuitive interface that supports both manual parameter input and pre-loaded sample data, making exoplanet discovery accessible to a global audience.
